Sidamo Cafe Finder
==================

This is a web application intended for mobile device use that queries the Google Places API to find nearby cafes. 

It will initially find cafes within a 5 mile radius. It will render these results in a simple list. v2 will then include caching of API results, map views as well as filters for 'decent' coffee as deemed suitable by the developer.

It utilizes Nodejs and the google maps client on the server end.
